        Hello. My name is Colan Biemer (he/him). Fun fact about my name: It was misspelled on the birth certificate. So for the pronunciation of my name,  imagine my name was spelled like "Colin."

        I am a PhD candidate at Northeastern University. My advisor is Seth Cooper. I'm working on my dissertation, which has the long title: Dynamic Level Progressions via Procedural Level Generation Guided by a Markov Decision Process for Platformers and Roguelikes. I may add a Match-3 game if I have time.

        When I'm not working on my research or programming some side project for fun, I'm likely doing something with my perfect dog or reading a book. My two favorite books are <i>A Christmas Carol</i> by Charles Dickens and <i>Stoner</i> by John Williams.
