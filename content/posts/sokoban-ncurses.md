In my [previous video](../sokoban-with-bitboards), I implemented [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) in [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) using [bitboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard), but the experience of playing the game was somewhat dull. So, I figured that it may be fun to improve the experience by making use of [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/). It's a lot shorter this time.

Hope you enjoy.
