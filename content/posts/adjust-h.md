----

Stop recompiling your C code just to change a number. adjust.h is a single-header library that lets you edit variables while your program is running - no rebuilds needed. Just include the header, mark your variables, and watch them update live as you edit your source file. In this video, I'll show you how to set it up and demonstrate why this simple tool can save you time.

Works with any C99 compiler and integrates perfectly with Raylib, ImGui, and other popular libraries. Whether you're tweaking game physics, adjusting graphics parameters, or fine-tuning algorithms, adjust.h will make your life simpler. Zero dependencies, minimal setup, maximum productivity.
