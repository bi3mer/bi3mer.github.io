While I was TA'ing C++, the professor for the class asked all the TAs to record a forty minute long video on some topic related to C++. I figured it may be useful to see someone coding a game from scratch, so that's what I did with part 1, which was Sokoban with bitboards. I enjoyed programming the game and making the first video, though, and I decided to keep going. The result was a [31 Part Youtube Series!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwaZncztKsRckZ0u3sKbwkZMtH1-ABkDR)
