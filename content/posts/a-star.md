Learn how pathfinding algorithms work through interactive visualizations. In this video, I implement and compare three fundamental search algorithms - Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* - showing exactly how each one explores a grid to find the optimal path.

We'll cover how DFS explores deeply before backtracking, why BFS guarantees the shortest path in unweighted grids, and how A* uses heuristics to find paths efficiently. Everything is implemented in C using Raylib for visualization with terrain generation via Perlin noise.
