In my [previous video](../sokoban-ncurses), I updated the code to use [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/). In this one, I take a break from implementing new functionality and instead reorganize the code to prepare for the next part of the project.

I also made a GitHub repository for the project: [https://github.com/bi3mer/sokoban](https://github.com/bi3mer/sokoban)

Hope you enjoy!
