Hello. My name is Colan Biemer (he/him). Fun fact about my name: It was misspelled on the birth certificate. So for the pronunciation of my name, imagine my name was spelled like "Colin."

I am a recent PhD graduate from Northeastern University, where I was advised by Seth Cooper. My dissertation, *Dynamic Level Progressions via Procedural Level Generation Guided by a Markov Decision Process for Platformers and Roguelikes*, explored using reinforcement learning to guide procedural content generation for dynamic difficulty adjustment in games. Outside of my research, I like to make games, most of which are [playable online](/games) or downloadable via [GitHub](https://github.com/bi3mer).

When I'm not working on my research or programming some side project for fun, I'm likely doing something with my perfect dog or reading a book. My two favorite books are *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens and *Stoner* by John Williams.
