## Post-Dissertation Work
- [adjust.h](https://github.com/bi3mer/adjust.h/blob/main/adjust.h) - A single header library written in `c99` for adjusting hardcoded values while the application is running.

## Dissertation Work
- [Ponos](https://github.com/bi3mer/ponos) - A tool for building a [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) that assembles video game levels for dynamic difficult adjustment. It is the work behind my dissertation, and it combines the work of three of my papers into one.
  - [ponos-example](https://github.com/bi3mer/ponos-example) - A repo to provide an eample of how Ponos could be used for *Mario*.
- [GDM](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM) - GDM stands for graph based decision making. This repo allows the user to define a graph, and that graph is operated on as if it were a [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) to make decisions. This tool is used in my paper [Level Assembly as a Markov Decision Process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13922) and my dissertation.
- [GDM-TS](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM-TS) - A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) version of [GDM](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM) that is used for online player studies.
- [GDM-Editor](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM-Editor) - A tool for modifying and building [GDM](https://github.com/bi3mer/GDM) graphs by hand.
