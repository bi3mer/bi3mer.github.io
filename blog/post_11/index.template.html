			<h2>
				A Brief Note
			</h2>
			<p>
				Apologies for the delay in the posts, I have been working on applications. Despite not writing updates, I have made a meatball every week since. As a result, a series of posts will be coming out, kind of quickly, to catch up to the meatball I’m going to make tonight. I’m pretty excited. The improvements have been substantial, even if each week has been a smaller improvement than I would have liked.
			</p>
			<h2>
				This Week in Meatballs
			</h2>
			<p>
				Last week, was the first week I ever made a meatball. This week I am experimenting with the time a meatball should spend in the sauce. My main take away from the week before was that at 45 minutes, the meatball has lost everything that made it good. Therefore, I’ve decided to test in five-minute intervals, starting at 10 minutes.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Modifications
			</h2>
			<p>
				For this meatball, I’ve decided to pour a small amount of the sauce into the meatball mixture. I think it will help tie everything in together. However, on the taste test with a small version, I found that the meatball was slightly undersalted with the addition of the sauce. In addition, I’m going to give the dutch oven, I use it to brown the meatballs, two minutes to cool down before adding the sauce to it.
			</p>
			<h2>
				10 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The sauce isn’t really apart of the meatball</li>
				<li>Ricotta is already gone</li>
				<li>Salt is fine</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 5/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				15 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fat from meatball is visibly in the sauce</li>
				<li>Salt is still fine</li>
				<li>The viscosity of sauce is wrong, taking the top off</li>
				<li>Meatball flavor is basically lost</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 4/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				20 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The sauce tastes really good now</li>
				<li>The texture of meatball is perfect</li>
				<li>Salt is still fine</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 4/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				25 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The texture is now starting to become loose</li>
				<li>The sauce is still tasting better</li>
				<li>The meatball has basically lost itself</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 3/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				30 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Meatball is super dry</li>
				<li>The texture is too hard</li>
				<li>This definitely needs some kind of acid</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 3/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				35 Minutes
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The sauce is too powerful at this point</li>
				<li>Can’t taste much of the meatball, all the flavor has gone into the sauce</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Score: 2/10
			</p>
			<h2>
				Results
			</h2>
			<p>
				Adding the sauce into the meatball was definitely the right call, but past that it wasn’t that great. I have decided to cut the parsley and oregano finer than before. In addition, I will uncover the sauce once the meatballs go into the sauce. I’m also starting to think that the meatball just shouldn’t go into the sauce at all, besides a quick dunk to coat them. I’m also going to experiment with using lemon or balsamic vinegar as an acid for the meatball. It definitely needs something to balance out the flavors.
