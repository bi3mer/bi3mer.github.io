      N-Grams With Harry Potter

  <div class="post-content"><p>I recently started grad school and one of the classes I am taking is Natural Language Processing (NLP). Before the class I decided to watch a few videos on NLP and came across N-Grams. I have not made it known in any of my past posts but I love N-Grams. One of my projects is around reinforcing N-Grams which I hope to post about sometime later this year. Digression aside, I decided it would be a fun project to write an n-gram that uses the text of Harry Potter as input and see what we get; I know it isn&rsquo;t the most original idea but it was fun.</p>
<p>Before we can get into the results, let&rsquo;s go over n-grams. The &ldquo;n&rdquo; in n-gram is meant to represent some integer greater than 0. The &ldquo;gram&rdquo; is short for grammar. When you put it together you get a grammar that takes an input of size <code>n</code> and returns the word that is likely to be next. Let&rsquo;s take a small example sentence to show the concept, &ldquo;Colan was here yesterday and was here today.&rdquo; With this example let&rsquo;s construct a n-gram where <code>n</code> is equal to two.</p>
<p>To parse this sentence for a n-gram of size two, the first input is &ldquo;Colan was&rdquo; and the result is &ldquo;here.&rdquo; Meaning when the grammar receives the phrase &ldquo;Colan was&rdquo; the grammar will expect the next word to be &ldquo;here.&rdquo; So let&rsquo;s show what the grammar looks like at this phase.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &#34;Colan was&#34;: {
    &#34;here&#34;: 1
  }
}
</code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we have &ldquo;here&rdquo; correspond to the value of one. This is because we are currently parsing the input and keeping track of the number of occurrences. When we are done setting up our input we can compile the grammar into something that will predict the next output. But more on that after we are done counting the occurrences. The next set of input is &ldquo;was here&rdquo; with the result of &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;. Following that you will get &ldquo;was yesterday&rdquo; corresponding to &ldquo;and.&rdquo; This will go on until we get the final result below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &#34;Colan was&#34;: {
    &#34;here&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;was here&#34;: {
  	&#34;yesterday&#34;: 1,
  	&#34;today&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;here yesterday&#34;: {
  	&#34;and&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;yesterday and&#34;: {
  	&#34;was&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;and was&#34;: {
  	&#34;here&#34;: 1
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Now that we have created a grammar that counts all the occurrences we can compile it which means we can turn it into a set of probabilities. There are two ways to do this, weighted and unweighted. What I call the unweighted approach is one where the occurrences are ignored and each potential value is given the same weight. In this case we would take &ldquo;was here&rdquo; and automatically apply <code>0.5</code> to both values regardless of how many occurrences there actually were. The weighted approach is one where we do use the occurrences and calculate each value by dividing the values occurrences by the number of occurrences for the key. In our example, both the weighted and the unweighted versions are the same.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &#34;Colan was&#34;: {
    &#34;here&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;was here&#34;: {
  	&#34;yesterday&#34;: 0.5,
  	&#34;today&#34;: 0.5
  },
  &#34;here yesterday&#34;: {
  	&#34;and&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;yesterday and&#34;: {
  	&#34;was&#34;: 1
  },
  &#34;and was&#34;: {
  	&#34;here&#34;: 1
  }
}
</code></pre><p>With this compiled version we can now use this grammar to predict the next word and generate some interesting text. In our case we can use the input &ldquo;Colan was.&rdquo; Looking at the compiled grammar we know the value given back is &ldquo;here.&rdquo; However, if we continued it would then take &ldquo;was here&rdquo; and return either &ldquo;today&rdquo; or &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo; with both having a fifty percent chance. If we continued it would generate something like, &ldquo;Colan was here yesterday and was here yesterday and was here yesterday and was here today.&rdquo; Notice that once we get to &ldquo;today,&rdquo; it can no longer generate anything.</p>
<p>This example, while small, shows the strengths and weakness of n-grams. It is an incredible structure that can quickly mimic style and technique used in the input to produce interesting but similar results. The larger the n, the more sensible the output will be as well as the more similar it will be to the input. On the other hand, it is limited by its very strengths. Ultimately we want AI to generate new and interesting things which n-grams can inherently not do.</p>
<p>Now that we, hopefully, understand n-grams we can get to what happens when we apply n-grams of sizes one to six on the first two books of Harry Potter. If you would like to see my implementation of this you can see the <a href="https://github.com/bi3mer/nlp_experiments/blob/master/naive_n_gram.py">source on github</a>. I think you can see that the weighted versions of the grammar tend to read a bit more sensibly, especially when n is lower. You&rsquo;ll also notice that n-grams can have trouble with quotes, especially when they are long and use commonly found phrases.</p>
